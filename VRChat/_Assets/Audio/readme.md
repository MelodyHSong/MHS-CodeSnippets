> "Beeps, boops, and ambient loops."

Here lie the sound waves. This folder contains all Sound Effects (SFX) and Background Music (BGM).

## ☆ File Types
* **.WAV**: Used for short, high-quality SFX (uncompressed).
* **.OGG**: Used for longer background music or loops (compressed).

## ☆ VRChat Spatial Audio
* If this is **Background Music**: Set `Spatial Blend` to **2D** (0) on the AudioSource.
* If this is **World Sound** (like a fireplace): Set `Spatial Blend` to **3D** (1) so players can hear where it's coming from.
