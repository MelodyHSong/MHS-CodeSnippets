# ☆ Model Repository ☆

> "The geometry of the world."

This folder contains the raw 3D mesh files (FBX or OBJ) before they are turned into Prefabs.

## ☆ Contents
* **Props/**: Small items (chairs, cups, lamps).
* **Environment/**: Walls, floors, and large structures.
* **Characters/**: Avatars or NPCs (if any).

## ☆ Import Settings Check
* **Scale Factor**: Ensure the Scale Factor is set correctly (usually 1) so objects don't appear giant or microscopic.
* **Read/Write Enabled**: If a script needs to touch the vertices (like a mesh deformation script), check this box in the Import Settings!
