# ☆ Texture Atlas ☆

> "Pixels, paint, and polish."

This directory stores all the raw image data used for UI, 3D models, and particles.

## ☆ Organization
* **UI/**: Sprites for menus and HUDs.
* **Icons/**: Small graphics for toggles or inventory items.
* **Surfaces/**: Albedo, Normal, Metallic, and Emission maps for 3D objects.

## ☆ Optimization Note
For VRChat performance:
1. Try to keep textures in **Powers of 2** (e.g., 512, 1024, 2048).
2. Use **Crunch Compression** in the import settings if the file size is too big!
