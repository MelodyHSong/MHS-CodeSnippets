# ☆ Assets & Materials ☆

> "The paint, the sounds, and the textures."

This is the resource chest! Here you will find the supporting files that make the prefabs and scripts look (and sound) good.

## ☆ Contents
* **Materials/**: Standard and custom shaders used on meshes.
* **Textures/**: Icons, UI sprites, and surface maps.
* **Audio/**: Sound effects (SFX) and background loops.
* **Models/**: FBX or Obj files for 3D meshes.

## ☆ Usage Note
Please do not move or rename these files if you are using the **_Prefabs**, as it might break the references (pink materials are scary!).
