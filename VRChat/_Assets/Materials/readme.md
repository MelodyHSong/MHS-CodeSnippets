# ☆ Material Library ☆

> "The clothes our meshes wear."

This folder contains the **Material (.mat)** files and any custom **Shaders (.shader)** used in the project.

## ☆ Contents
* **Standard/**: Materials using Unity's Standard shader or VRChat Mobile shaders.
* **Custom/**: Fancy shaders (water, holographic, particles).
* **PhysMaterials/**: Bounciness and friction settings.

## ☆ Usage Tip
If a material looks pink (magenta) in your scene, it means the shader is missing or the render pipeline is mismatched. Check the **Shader** dropdown in the Inspector!
