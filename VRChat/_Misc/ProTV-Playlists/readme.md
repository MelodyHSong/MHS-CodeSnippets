Here is the README.md for your ProTV-Playlists folder. I made sure to emphasize the "Work Smarter, Not Harder" aspect of using AI for the data entry!
# ☆ ProTV Playlists ☆

> "Curated vibes, automated effort."

This directory contains the playlist data files used for the **ProTV** systems in my VRChat worlds. These files control the queue, the jams, and the background noise.

## ☆ The "Secret" Ingredient

You might notice some of these playlists are massive (we're talking 150+ songs).

**Full Disclosure:** These lists were generated and populated with the help of **Google Gemini**. 

Why? Because ain't no way I was going to manually copy-paste over 150 YouTube URLs one by one. I love you guys, and I love music, but I value my sanity more. 🤖✨

## ☆ Contents
Since I update and rename my vibes regularly, I won't list the specific filenames here. generally, you will find:
* **_Mixes**
* **_AmbienceLoops**
* **_Video/MovieQueues**

## ☆ Usage
1. These files are formatted for the **ProTV** media player.
2. Import the JSON/Text file into your ProTV Playlist Manager component in Unity.
3. Hit play and enjoy!
