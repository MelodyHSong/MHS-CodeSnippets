# ☆ Prefab Collection ☆

> "Ready-to-go magic for your world."

This folder contains pre-assembled **GameObjects** that are ready to drag and drop into your scene. These prefabs usually come with the scripts and components already attached and configured.

## ☆ Installation
1. Drag the `.prefab` file from this folder into your **Hierarchy**.
2. Check the Inspector! Some prefabs require you to link a specific object (like a Spawn Point or a UI Text element) to work properly.

## ☆ Note on Unpacking
If you need to modify the internal structure of these objects:
* Right-click the object in the Hierarchy.
* Select **Prefab > Unpack Completely**.
* *Warning: This breaks the link to the original file, so updates won't apply to your unpacked version!*
